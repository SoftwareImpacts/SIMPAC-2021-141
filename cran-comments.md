## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE: 
Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  NJTR (10:164)

This is a proper acronym for the type of traffic data covered by this package, and can be disregarded.

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on all downstream dependencies used by zipcodeR using revdep. There were no errors.
