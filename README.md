`njtr1` is an R package that provides provides an interface to easily download car crash records maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation. These records are collected from police officers in New Jersey when they complete the form NJTR-1 following a motor vehicle collision that is reported to law enforcement.

This package facilitates the download of multiple tables from the NJDOT and formatting of them so that they display properly in R.

This package currently provides data from 2017 - 2019. We are currently working on implementing the format of the older data from 2016 prior.
